# SpineOpt

SpineOpt.jl is an integrated energy systems optimization model part of the Spine Tools organization, striving towards adaptability for a multitude of modelling purposes.
The data-driven model structure allows for highly customizable energy system descriptions, as well as flexible temporal and stochastic structures, without the need to alter the model source code directly. The methodology is based on mixed-integer linear programming (MILP).
